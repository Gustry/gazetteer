These are pointers rather tahn complete notes on installation.  

The installation requires that the sqlalchemy and geoalchemy modules are installed into 
python.  

The install.sh and similar scripts in the src/sql folder assist installing the 
PostGresql database.

Several files need updating to include database strings etc.  These include:

src/NZGBplugin/Plugin.py <server> is url of the web server from which the plugin is delivered
src/gazetteer/gazetteer_roles.sql  '*******' is a password by the "web application" 
   (not part of this repository)
src/setenv.sh Install the credentials for dev, uat, and prod databases
