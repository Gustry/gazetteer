  <h3>Search by name</h3>

  <p>Enter a name or search term eg. &rsquo;pond&lsquo; in the
  search box above the map, and press &lsquo;Enter&rsquo; or click
  the <img src="/Client/images/search24.png" />icon. Results will
  be shown in the Matches Found panel, to the right of the map.</p>

  <p>Note: When you zoom into the map, only matching names, or
  search terms, located within the area displayed in the map will
  be shown. Zoom out to increase the search area.</p>

  <p>Deleting the name, or search term, in the search box will
  clear the search.</p>

  <p>The total number of names that match your search criteria is
  displayed in the panel heading. The names are listed
  alphabetically and this list is limited to a preset number of
  results. To reduce the number of names found, you may need to
  refine your search.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>You can refine your search in two ways:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>refining the search term and/or</li>

    <li>zooming in.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4><em>Selecting an area of the map and zooming in</em></h4>

  <p>You can zoom into an area on the map by:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>clicking on the <img src="/sites/default/files/images/openlayers/editing6.png" />icon, and drawing a rectangle
    over the area you&rsquo;re interested in.&nbsp;<br />
    - Note: Remember to select the <img src="/sites/default/files/images/openlayers/editing5.png" />icon afterwards to
    return the cursor to pointer mode (allowing panning around the
    map - see Panning below)</li>

    <li>drawing a rectangle by holding down the shift key and
    dragging the mouse pointer.</li>

    <li>using the scale bar and directional arrows at the top left
    of the map.</li>

    <li>double clicking on the map.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><em>Panning around the map</em></h4>

  <p>The <img src="/sites/default/files/images/openlayers/editing5.png" />icon allows you to pan around the map by
  clicking and dragging on the map. &nbsp;As the map view changes,
  the names on the Matches Found panel will update automatically.
  Note that if you are at maximum extent (viewing all of New
  Zealand) you will not be able to pan around the map.</p>

  <h3>Searching by location</h3>

  <p>You can find all features within an area by zooming in to the
  <u>higher</u> zoom levels.</p>

  <p>With the search box clear, zoom into the relevant area until
  the <em>Matches Found</em> returns the features in that area. As
  you pan or zoom the map further the <em>Matches Found</em> panel
  will refresh automatically. You can further refine your search as
  described above.</p>

  <h4><em>Resetting your search</em></h4>

  <p>You can quickly reset your search using the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Changing or clearing the text in the search box: This
    resets the results in the Matches Found panel, and retains the
    current zoom level.</li>

    <li>Selecting the map control icon <img src=
    "/Client/scripts/OpenLayers-2.12/img/zoom-world-mini.png" />:
    This resets the zoom and retains the text in the search
    box.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Pressing Ctrl F5: This resets the Gazetteer webpage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><em>Identifying place names on the map</em></h4>

  <p>To see the name corresponding to a feature on the map, ensure
  that the <img src="/sites/default/files/images/openlayers/editing5.png" /> icon is selected and place your mouse cursor over
  either the feature on the map or the place name listed in the
  <em>Matches Found</em> panel. &nbsp;The feature will change from
  orange to yellow and the place name will also appear on the map
  at the bottom left. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Click either the feature on the map or the name listed in the
  <em>Matches Found</em> panel for more details. See below for
  description of <em>Details Panel</em>.</p>

  <h4><em>Tips</em></h4>

  <p>The<img src="/sites/default/files/images/openlayers/navigation4.png" /> icon allows you to return to your previous
  map positions. Click the <img src="/sites/default/files/images/openlayers/navigation2.png" /> icon to move forward.
  &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Along the right side of the map view are two <img src=
  "/Client/scripts/OpenLayers-2.12/img/layer-switcher-maximize.png" />
   symbols. &nbsp;Clicking on the top symbol allows you to turn the
  overlays (e.g. name labels) on and off. &nbsp;The Basemap cannot
  be turned off.</p>

  <p><img src="/sites/default/files/images/openlayers/baselayer.png" /></p>

  <p>Clicking on the bottom symbol opens an overview map that shows
  the area you are currently viewing in the main map. Moving the
  red target box will pan the main map view.</p>

  <p><img src="/sites/default/files/images/openlayers/baselayer2.png" /></p>

  <p>Clicking on the panel headings <em>How to Use</em>,
  <em>Matches Found</em> and <em>Details</em>, will open the
  selected panel.</p>

  <h3>The Base Map</h3>

  <p>The map provides some topographic layer names at certain
  scales to provide context and help with navigating the map.</p>

  <h4><em>Matches found</em></h4>

  <h4>This panel provides a list of names that meet your search
  criteria.</h4>

  <p>If a name is official, it will be shown in bold.</p>

  <p>If a feature is located beyond the maximum extent of the map,
  a corresponding message will be displayed beneath the name.</p>

  <p>When you click on a name listed in the <em>Matches Found</em>
  panel or on a highlighted feature on the map, the
  <em>Details</em> panel will appear, providing more detail on that
  particular name or feature.</p>

  <h4><em>Details</em></h4>

  <p>The <em>Details</em> panel shows information about the name
  selected, as well as information about the feature itself and any
  other names for that feature.</p>

  <p>To return to the list of names, click on the <em>Matches
  Found</em> panel heading.</p>
